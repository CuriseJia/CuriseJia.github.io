<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a first-year PhD student at the Nanyang Technological University, CCDS, supervised by Prof. [Mengmi Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G2sVOhcAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am working as a research intern at Peking University, advised by Prof. [Li Yuan](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1046/2678.htm) since April 2023. Before joining PKU, I have been an AI4Edu Algorithm Researcher and lead the developer team of [OpenXLab-Edu](https://xedu.readthedocs.io/zh/master/about/team.html) at Shanghai AI Lab in 2021-2023.

🤔 My research interests include Multi-Modal Retrieval, AI4Science Tasks, and NeuronScience. I keep collobration with my friends Dr. [Hao Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y4va91AAAAAJ&hl=en) on Multi-Modal Tasks and Dr. [Xinyi Wu](https://riesummer.github.io/) on AI4Education. Specially, I aim to develop models with human reasoning capabilities and liberate human productivity.


🤝 **Looking for collobration. If you are interested in working with me in AI tasks or AI4Sci tasks, please drop me an email.**
